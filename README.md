## Hi, I'm Stu!
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/StuFleisher/StuFleisher/assets/131288494/a424f173-4e25-41f0-8521-1bb3492356f4">


I'm a software engineer with a passion for supporting artists and creators. For 15 years I worked as an animator, director, and creative leader, solving technical challenges in media production, often by building small tools in JavaScript. Today I focus on the intersection of design and technology in order to help creatives thrive.

I am a pragmatic builder who loves seeing projects come to life. Having produced and directed successful media projects for some of the worldâ€™s biggest brands, I care deeply about quality and have an excellent eye for detail. I bring that experience into my coding as well by thinking strategically and designing carefully.

### My Projects

**Parsley (https://github.com/StuFleisher/Parsley-Backend)** - If you've ever found it frustrating to switch back and forth between the ingredients and instructions sections of a recipe, this App is for you. This recipe parser uses an LLM to restructure recipe data and automatically format recipes with the ingredients listed right next to their appearance in the instructions.

**Jobly (https://github.com/StuFleisher/react-jobly)** - A simple job board app I built to practice RESTful APIs and React.

**Warbler (https://github.com/StuFleisher/warbler)** - A microblogging app built in python and flask.
